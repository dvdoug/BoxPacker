Installation
============

The recommended way to install BoxPacker is to use `Composer`_. From the command line simply execute the following to add
``dvdoug/boxpacker`` to your project's ``composer.json`` file. Composer will automatically take care of downloading the source

.. code::

    composer require dvdoug/boxpacker

If you don't want to use Composer, the code is available to download from `GitHub`_
